When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share you work with others or when more than one user is working on the same files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If there are multiple people working on files, automatic pulls could get confusing. Also, you may not always want to pull from the same branch, and an automatic process would either require additional setup or would have to make guesses about what you wanted. Neither of these cases seems desirable.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a new repository in your own account based on someone else's repository. You would use a fork if you want to experiment with making changes to an existing repository that you may or may not suggest to the repository owner. A clone is a copy of a repository that you can directly push to. You would use a clone on a project you're directly working on or own. A branch is a part of a repository. You use a branch either to test out new features or to create an alternative version of the files in a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work on it offline and then merge and push your updates later.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without a version control system like Git/GitHub, collaboration could involve sharing files by email and keeping archived versions by, say, date. The only thing easier about this method is not having to learn a version control system. Actually keeping track of updates and merging changes with those from other collaborators would be much harder and more error prone.

~~~~~
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If you are collaborating with others, you should never make changes directly to the master. Changes should be made to a separate branch, which should be checked by your collaborators prior to incorporating the updates into the master. The benefit of changing the master directly is that it is faster and has fewer steps. The benefit of updating a branch and having it checked out prior to incorporating into the master is that there is less chance of messing up the master, which could negatively impact other collaborators.
